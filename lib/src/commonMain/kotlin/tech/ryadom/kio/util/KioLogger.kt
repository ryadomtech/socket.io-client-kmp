/**
 * Interface for logging messages within the Kio library.
 * This interface provides a flexible way to integrate with different logging frameworks.
 *
 * Implement this interface to customize how log messages are handled.
 * By default, no logging is performed unless a concrete implementation is provided.
 *
 * The `debug`, `info`, `warn`, and `error` functions are convenience methods
 * that delegate to the `log` function with the appropriate [LogLevel].
 *
 * The `message` parameter in the logging functions is a lambda (`() -> String`)
 * to allow for lazy evaluation of the log message. This can improve performance
 * if the message construction is expensive and the log level is not enabled.
